Worked for several central banks, and cares about growth, inflation, interest rates - and good forecasting models!\nThis blog outlines my thinking behind the posts on https://twitter.com/EconomicsShiny. As I found myself playing with data and thinking about automating notifications and tweets about new data releases, I realized that not all information may be self-explanatory, and so I decided to write up my thoughts.\nGood to know:\nCode for the tweets can be found at https://github.com/pmaier1971/AutomatedEconomicAnalysis.\nAll economoic data is sourced from FRED (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/); all COVID-related data is from https://covid19datahub.io.\nAll views, and all errors, are mine.\nPosts are created with RStudio/R and the awesome Distill package. Learn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\n\n\n\n",

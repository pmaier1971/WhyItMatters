Dad. Passionate economist. Lousy coder. Intrigued by current developments. Worked for several central banks, and cares about growth, inflation, interest rates - and good forecasting models! 

This blog outlines my thinking behind the posts on https://twitter.com/EconomicsShiny. As I found myself playing with data and thinking about automating notifications and tweets about new data releases, I realized that not all information may be self-explanatory, and so I decided to write up my thoughts.

Good to know:

- Code for the tweets can be found at https://github.com/pmaier1971/AutomatedEconomicAnalysis.

- All economoic data is sourced from FRED (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/); all COVID-related data is from https://covid19datahub.io. 

- **All views, and all errors, are mine.**

Posts are created with RStudio/R and the awesome Distill package. Learn more about using Distill at <https://rstudio.github.io/distill>.
